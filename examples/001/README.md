# 🌙 LunaLander with PPO 🚀

Welcome to the **LunaLander** example using **Proximal Policy Optimization (PPO)**! 🚀✨

This code is inspired by **UNIT 1** of the **Deep RL Course** from **Hugging Face**. 🎓💡 
If you’re looking to learn more about the concepts and hands-on tutorials from this course, be sure to check out the full [UNIT 1: Hands-on](https://huggingface.co/learn/deep-rl-course/unit1/hands-on) guide! 📚

## 🛠️ Let's Set Up LunaLander! 🚀

Before we dive into the **LunaLander** action, let's get everything ready! 🙌 You’ll need to have the **uv** package and project manager installed to keep things running smoothly. If you don’t have it yet, no worries! 🧰

You can grab uv from its [GitHub repository](https://github.com/astral-sh/uv), or just run this super simple one-liner to install it:

```bash
# On macOS and Linux.
curl -LsSf https://astral.sh/uv/install.sh | sh
```

Now, why are we using **uv**? 🤔 It’s our secret weapon to set up the perfect environment for each project. Every project here has its own tailored setup, and **uv** makes sure you get exactly what you need for the **LunaLander** to run without a hitch. 🎯


### 📦 Initialize the Example:

```bash
# you must be in path examples/001/
uv python pin 3.12
uv init 
rm main.py
uv venv --python 3.12 # We want be sure that version is 3.12
```

We’re almost there! But before we get our virtual rocket flying, there are a couple of dependencies we need to take care of... 🚀

### 🖥️ Install Xvfb & SWIG:

First up, we need **Xvfb** (X Virtual Framebuffer) – it’s like a phantom display server that runs in the background, so we don’t need a real screen to see things in action. 🖥️✨

Then, we need **SWIG** (Simplified Wrapper and Interface Generator) for Box2D in Gymnasium.

Install them with:

```bash
sudo apt-get install xvfb
sudo apt-get install swig
```

### 📥 Install Project Dependencies:

Time to install the necessary packages for the experiment so everything works as expected! 💻✨

Make sure you're in the **examples/001/** directory and run:


```bash
# you must be in path examples/001/
uv add -r requirements.txt
```


### 🧑‍🏫 Configure Jupyter Notebooks:

Almost ready! Now we’ll set up **Jupyter** with some sweet extensions to make your coding experience even smoother. 🎉

```bash
uv add  jupyter_contrib_nbextensions && uv run jupyter contrib nbextension install --user  && uv run jupyter nbextension enable varInspector/main && uv run jupyter nbextension enable spellchecker/main  && uv run jupyter nbextension enable codefolding/main && uv run jupyter nbextension enable hinterland/hinterland && uv run jupyter nbextension enable execute_time/ExecuteTime --user
 ```

 ### 🚀 Launch Jupyter Notebook:

Now that everything is set up, it’s time to launch Jupyter and start experimenting with LunaLander! 🎮

Run the following to start the notebook:

```bash
uv run jupyter notebook --ip='*' --NotebookApp.token='' --NotebookApp.password=''
```
There you go! Everything’s ready for you to start landing on the moon with **LunaLander**. 🌙 

Let’s make some magic happen! ✨🚀
